# DSA-BOOT-CAMP
We post a weekly data structure and algorithm challenge. Just solve it in any language you prefer.
keeping code, dont be a cry baby.


## Contributing
Youâ€™ll receive 10 questions every week, posted every Monday. You must complete them before Sunday. Organize your work in the respective year and date folder. For example, for the year 2024, the folder name would be '2024', and the date folder could be '11-11-17-11', which represents the tasks to be completed from November 11 to November 17. Inside the folder, you will find the tasks to be done."

  ### Workflow
  All code contributions should be made on the 'dev' branch. Once you're done, create a pull request (PR) to merge your changes into the 'main' branch.
